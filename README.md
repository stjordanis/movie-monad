## Is Movie Monad the free video player I've been looking for?

Yes. :heavy_check_mark:  

Movie Monad is a free and simple to use video player made with Haskell.
Originally it was a proof of concept to add video playback to
[Gifcurry](https://lettier.github.io/gifcurry/) (another great app—check it out).
Nowadays it's a lightweight yet mighty media player used all over the
[world](https://snapcraft.io/movie-monad#js-snap-map)
:globe_with_meridians: everyday.

Movie Monad is cross platform so you'll never have to watch without it.
Stream videos from the web or play the files stored on your computer.
Play, pause, seek, repeat, resize, expand, and turn it up—Movie Monad gets out of
the way so you can watch the videos you love. :heartbeat:

So try out Movie Monad—it'll make your life simpler. :sunglasses:
